abstract:  Wireless federated learning (FL) holds the potential of preserving data privacy and reducing network traffic congestion, thereby attracting much recent attention. Due to the fading nature of wireless channels, wireless FL suffers from the random delay in each uplink and downlink transmission. As a result, how to analyze the overall random delay of a FL task over wireless fading channels remains open. To solve this challenging problem, we present a saddle point approximation based approach to obtain the distribution of the delay caused by communication in wireless FL systems. In particular, we obtain the uplink delay distribution and the downlink delay distribution by Lugannani-Rice formula. The overall delay distribution is then obtained through the convolution of those two distributions and the generating function. Simulation results demonstrate that the theoretical results provide accurate characterizations for the empirical results, which corroborates the validity of the analysis in this paper.
